# ClickDV Project Context

## Instructions
**Follow all global preferences in ~/CLAUDE.md, plus the project-specific additions below.**

## Project Overview
GLM project linking Poisson click input data from rats to decision variable outputs. This is a computational neuroscience project for the Brody-Daw lab rotation.

## Research Goals
- Extract decision variables from spike data (starting with session A324)
- Access and analyze click times from behavioral data
- Develop GLM to link click inputs to decision variables DV(t)
- Investigate how GLM weights differ between sessions
- Explore direct link between click inputs and decision making

## Project-Specific Overrides & Additions

### Communication Style (extends global)
- No unnecessary praise - I want thought from a good assistant, not a sycophant
- Give explanations of technical concepts

### Project Context (overrides global)
- Focus on computational neuroscience and GLM modeling (not physics)
- Prioritize accuracy and reproducibility
- Use proper statistical analysis methods
- Generate publication-quality outputs

### Programming Education Goals (extends global)
- Introduce advanced statistical modeling concepts
- Explain GLM theory and implementation
- Connect theory to real-world neuroscience applications

## Important Instructions
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving the goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested
