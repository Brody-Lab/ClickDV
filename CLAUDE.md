# ClickDV Project Context

## Project Overview
GLM project linking Poisson click input data from rats to decision variable outputs. This is a computational neuroscience project for the Brody-Daw lab rotation.

## Research Goals
- Extract decision variables from spike data (starting with session A324)
- Access and analyze click times from behavioral data
- Develop GLM to link click inputs to decision variables DV(t)
- Investigate how GLM weights differ between sessions
- Explore direct link between click inputs and decision making

## Global Claude Preferences

### Communication Style
- Keep responses concise and technical
- No unnecessary praise - I want thought from a good assistant, not a sycophant
- Give explanations of technical concepts
- Use bullet points for complex information
- Avoid unnecessary preamble or postamble

### Default Behaviors
- Always use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
- For anything beyond a very simple task, always make a plan before coding
- Proactively search and understand codebases before making changes
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Run lint/typecheck commands after code changes
- Always commit changes after major modifications with clear, descriptive commit messages

### Technical Preferences
- Prefer performance-optimized implementations
- Use type hints in Python code
- Include proper error handling
- Follow academic/research coding standards

### Project Context
- Focus on computational neuroscience and GLM modeling
- Prioritize accuracy and reproducibility
- Use proper statistical analysis methods
- Generate publication-quality outputs

### Programming Education Goals
- Introduce advanced statistical modeling concepts
- Emphasize clean, scalable, and extensible code architecture
- Explain GLM theory and implementation
- Connect theory to real-world neuroscience applications
- Build on existing computational background
- Focus on scientific computing best practices

### Tool Usage
- Use parallel tool calls for efficiency
- Prefer existing file editing over creating new files
- Use comprehensive search before implementation
- Maintain organized project structure

## Important Instructions
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving the goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested
